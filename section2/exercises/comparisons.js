//-------------------
// PART 1: Comparing variables
//-------------------

var numberTeachers = 4;

var numberStudents = 20;

var stringTeachers = "4";

var numberDogs = 0;

// EXAMPLE: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?
console.log("Is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?", numberTeachers > numberStudents);
// this should log: "Is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?" false

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers less than numberStudents?
// this should log: true

console.log("Is numberTeachers less than numberStudents?", numberTeachers < numberStudents);

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers equal to stringTeachers? (use the == operator)
// this should log: true

console.log("Is numberTeachers equal to stringTeachers?", numberTeachers == stringTeachers);

/*
Note: this is an example of type coercion. Although stringTeachers is a string and numberStudents is an integer,
this statement still evaluated to true. JavaScript forces the stringTeachers into an integer to
perform this evaluation
*/

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers strictly equal to stringTeachers? (use the === operator)
// this should log: false

console.log("is numberTeachers strictly equal to stringTeachers?", numberTeachers === stringTeachers);

/*
Note: the strictly equal to operator compares the value of the variable in addition to the type of the variable.
since the numberTeachers is an integer value and the stringTeachers is a string value, although they are both equal to 4,
the comparison still evaluates to false.

In JavaScript, it is a best practice to use the strict comparison. It is said that, anytime a developer
thinks they _need_ to use the `==` loose comparison, they are doing something they shouldn't be. To help
you develop good habits that follow best practice, from now on, use the strict comparison.
*/

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers not equal to numberStudents?
// this should log: true

console.log("is numberTeachers not equal to numberStudents?", numberTeachers !== numberStudents);

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents greater than or equal to 20?
// this should log: true

console.log("is numberStudents greater than or equal to 20?", numberStudents >= 20);

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents greater than or equal to 21?
// this should log: false

console.log("is numberStudents greater than or equal to 21?", numberStudents >= 21);

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents less than or equal to 20?
// this should log: true

console.log("is numberStudents less than or equal to 20?", numberStudents <= 20);

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents less than or equal to 21?
// this should log: true

console.log("is numberStudents less than or equal to 21?", numberStudents <= 21);


//-------------------
// PART 2: Articulating what you are doing
//-------------------

// For the following prompts, you will be given a line of code and your task is to type out a Comment,
// in English, explaining what that line of code is doing, including what the comparison will evaluate to.
// Be as technically precise as possible, but don't just copy and paste a definition from the readings.
// Make sure YOU can explain it that way!

console.log(4 < 9);

//YOU DO: Explain.

//Logging to the console "Is 4 less than 9?" results in the Boolean value "True"

var books = 3;

console.log(4 < books);

// YOU DO: Explain.

//The variable "books" is assigned the number 3. Then, we log "Is (the number)
//4 less than (the string) books?" which would return the Boolean value "false"
//since books has been assigned the number 3.

var friends = 6;

var siblings = 2;

console.log(friends > siblings);

// YOU DO: Explain.

//The variable "friends" is assigned the number 6; siblings is assigned the number 2.
//"Is friends greater than siblings?" is logged to the console, resulting in the
//Boolean value "true"

var attendees = 9;

var meals = 8;

console.log(attendees !== meals);

// YOU DO: Explain.

//The variable "attendees" is assigned the number 9; meals is assigned the number 8.
//"attendees is not equal to meals" is logged to the console, resulting in the Boolean
//value "true" since 8 !== 9


//-------------------
// PART 3: Logical Operators
//-------------------

var isHungry = true;
var finishedHomework = false;

// EXAMPLE:
// Determine if the user is hungry and has completed their homework
console.log(isHungry && finishedHomework);
// Determine if the user is hungry or has completed their homework
console.log(isHungry || finishedHomework);

var lovesToPlay = true;
var lovesDogPark = false;
var lovesTreats = true;
var age = 1;

// YOU DO:
// Determine if the dog loves to play and loves treats
console.log(lovesToPlay && lovesTreats);

// Determine if the dog loves to play and loves the dog park
console.log(lovesToPlay && lovesDogPark);

// Determine if the dog loves to play or loves the dog park
console.log(lovesToPlay || lovesDogPark);

// Determine if the dog loves to play and is a puppy
console.log(lovesToPlay && age);

// What did your final line of code evaluate to? Why do you think that is? Explain.

// ANSWER:

//It evaluated to 1. Age is entered as a number instead of as a string (if the variable was `var isPuppy = true`
//then it would have resulted in the Boolean "true") but since lovesToPlay is true and true is associated with 1
//in the same way false is with 0, I assume `console.log(1 && 1)` would come out to 1 as well. Let's test that out.

console.log(1 && 1)

//Yup, it does.

// FINAL CHECK
//-------------------

// Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the console
// as you would expect?
