## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

At the start of the program, I was *way* too quick to ask for help before exploring solutions myself, but now I think I've struck a decent balance. My usual workflow when encountering an error is:

- Check for typos

- Read the terminal messages

- Attempt to work around the issue myself (the more I understand, the more likely this is to pay off)

- search the Turing Slack for similar roadblocks other people faced

- Google it

- Make my own thread in the Slack asking for help with the issue


2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

- strings: letters and other characters

- numbers: integers, both positive and negative, fractions are represented with decimals (e.g. ".25")

- Booleans: true or false


3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

- console.log("Hello World!")

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

- "//" are used to make a code comment, being able to leave notes for people without interfering with the code itself is essential.  

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

- A variable is a sequence of letters, numbers or symbols that represents another value. If I had to explain it to a variable, I would say:
"What's your name? Billy? Okay Billy, your name is like a variable. When people are talking about you, they use your name. They might say 'Billy is five years old.' When people use the name Billy, they're not talking about the *name* Billy, they're talking about you, a person named Billy. Just like names are used to talk about the people they belong to, variables are used to talk about the things they describe."

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

- Spotify:

..* timesListened: number  

..* albums: string

..* genre: string


7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

- Concatenation is the joining of two different kinds of variables (a string, numbers or Booleans) together into one variable (a string).

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

- YouTube might use it to store how many times you have watched videos from a particular channel, that way they can capture a string (the channel name) and a number (how many times) in the same variable.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

- Which is more commonly used/practical, concatenation or interpolation?
